# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

## Entities and Attributes

#### 1.MEMBER-
member_id (Primary Key)

name

membershiptype

startdate

#### 2.PROGRAM-

programID (Primary Key)

programname

description

schedule

#### 3.TRAINER-

trainerID (Primary Key)

name

specialisation

experience

#### 4.PAYMENT-

paymentID (Primary Key)

amount

paymentdate

paymenttype

#### 5.SESSION-

sessionID (Primary Key)

date

time

type

#### 6.ATTENDENCE (Attendance)-

attendence_id (Primary Key)

status (values: present / absent)

## Relationships and Constraints
MEMBER — pays → PAYMENT
One member can make many payments. Each payment belongs to one member.
(1-to-Many)

MEMBER — Enrollment → PROGRAM
A member can enroll in multiple programs. A program can have many members.
(Many-to-Many)

PROGRAM — teaches → TRAINER
A trainer can teach multiple programs. A program can be taught by one or more trainers.
(Many-to-Many)

MEMBER — attends → SESSION
A member can attend many sessions. A session can be attended by many members.
(Many-to-Many)

SESSION — has → ATTENDENCE
A session can have many attendance records. Each attendance record belongs to a session.
(1-to-Many)

## Assumptions
Each member must have a valid membership (with start date and type).

A program may be taught by more than one trainer.

Enrollment is required before a member can attend sessions of a program.

Payments are linked directly to members, not to programs or sessions.

Attendance is tracked per session per member.

Status in attendance is limited to "present" or "absent".

A trainer may teach multiple programs but must have at least one specialization.

A member can attend multiple sessions but must be enrolled in at least one program.

## Result
Hence,the concepts of ER diagram is understood and applied by creating an ER diagram for a real world application.
